Prompts user for info on various bodily conditions of a patient, then returns a binary output of whether the patient in question has a heart disease or not with accuracy of ca. 85.246 %.

This project is my break into machine learning. I have practiced Python since elementary school to get me started with programming so that I can understand the plugins I use for my private Minecraft servers. Something that I obviously didn't do is use Python to code machine learning projects.
With this project, I could explore essentially the tip of the iceberg when it comes to AI, helping me get a general impression of what makes machine learning meaningful without getting discouraged by the nitty-gritty (those are covered by the Scikit-learn tools).
For my coming machine learning projects, I will look into how I can use Pandas and NumPy to interpret the MNIST dataset without using Scikit-learn.
Most of the project was developed within August 18-19, 2025.
